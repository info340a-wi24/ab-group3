            <h2>Problem/Data Domain: Reinvisioning food rating apps</h2>
            <p>
            Current restaurant review services like <a href="https://www.yelp.com/">Yelp,</a> Trip Adviser, and Google Business Profile all follow a similar format to evaluate and rank restaurants.
            (Establishments appear on a list with their average rating and or number of ratings). This leaves popular restaurants with a high number of reviews and 
            ratings remaining near the top of every search, leaving little room for newer and or less popular establishements to gain attraction and build a customer base.
            This makes it harder for return users to discover new restaurants and decreases the effectiveness of these services when a majority of the top results are
            all places the user has already visited. We also want to question whether this current process of searching for restaurants the most effective way to decide
            where to eat. The simple of process of finding tasty food and sitting down to eat is unecessarily complicated by an elaborate cycle of filtering results,
            checking ratings, reading reviews and comparing them to other restaurants. At the end of the day, there is no best decision when it comes to deciding what to eat,
            just options.

            <h3>Information</h3>
            <p>We will use <a href="https://www.yelp.com/dataset">Yelp Open Dataset</a>(Free JSON files business/user data, reviews, photos) to provide mock data</p>
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>
            Allows newer, small businesses to have a higher chance at being seen/reccomended to customers by promoting a social-media-like atmosphere where posts can go
            viral and restaurant owners are encouraged to innovate and create dishes that are pleasing to look at and exciting for people to try.
            </p>
            <p>
            Allows a more dynamic restaurant reccomendation system because users can find restaurants by viewing enticing posts of different dishes and then get redirected
            to the restaurant's profile. Makes for a more pleasureable food searching experience because it aims to get users excited about what they are going to try rather
            than feel stressed from having to compare too much information about different businesses or feel pressure to make a correct/optimal decision.
